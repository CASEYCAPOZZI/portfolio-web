# Portfolio TODO

A running list of outstanding tasks across `portfolio-web` and `portfolio-api`.
Update this file as things get done or priorities shift.

---

## 🔴 High Priority

### ~~portfolio-api — Fix ECS / ALB Production Deployment~~ ✅ RESOLVED
API returning `{"status":"UP and running!","environment":"production"}` — confirmed healthy.
- [ ] Verify `/swagger-ui/index.html` returns 200 and is browsable (not yet confirmed)

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### portfolio-web — Build Out the Playground Page
The `/playground` page exists but is minimal. It is intentionally hidden from the nav until it's ready.

- [ ] Design what the Playground should showcase (API explorer, latency sampler, uptime history, etc.)
- [ ] Implement the features
- [ ] **Once ready: re-add Playground to the nav**
  - File: `app/components/Navigation.tsx`
  - Uncomment the `FlaskConical` import and add back to `navItems`:
    ```ts
    { href: '/playground', label: 'Playground', icon: FlaskConical }
    ```

### portfolio-web — Resume Content Polish
Keep the web resume aligned with your PDF when you revise either one.

- [ ] **Keep `app/resume/page.tsx` and `public/Casey_Capozzi_Resume.pdf` in sync** after any content changes — update both at the same time

### ~~portfolio-web — Download Resume Button~~ ✅ Done
- [x] `public/Casey_Capozzi_Resume.pdf` served at `/Casey_Capozzi_Resume.pdf`
- [x] Download button on resume page header (`Download` Lucide icon)
- Workflow: replace `public/Casey_Capozzi_Resume.pdf` and refresh `app/resume/page.tsx` when the resume changes

### portfolio-web — Personal Projects Section
The home page has a "Check back soon" placeholder for personal projects.

- [ ] WI Outdoor Monitor — add a card when there is something to show
- [ ] Reloading & Ballistics app — add a card when there is something to show

---

## 🟢 Low Priority / Nice to Have

### portfolio-web
- [ ] Add active route highlighting to nav (already partially done with `pathname` check)
- [ ] Consider adding a `og:image` / social card meta tag for link previews
- [ ] Disclaimer footer note (AmFam) was removed — decide if it should live anywhere (e.g. `/resume`)
- [ ] Update `README.md` if project structure changes significantly

### portfolio-api
- [ ] Update `README.md` once Swagger URL is confirmed working in production
- [ ] Consider adding Spring profiles (`dev`, `prod`) for cleaner environment separation
- [ ] Evaluate whether PostgreSQL datasource should be wired up (currently excluded via autoconfigure)
